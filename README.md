# Programming with Cryptol and SAW

Purpose: The purpose of the course is to provide an overview of the
capabilities of Cryptol and the Software Analysis Workbench (SAW).

## Potential Flow

1. Description of Cryptol and SAW
2. Demonstrate example of a cryptographic primitive with Cryptol (and SAW?)
   - Possibly the packaged SALSA20 example
3. Show the ability of Cryptol / SAW to do equivalence checking
   - Demonstrate that it can do unit tests as well
   - Explain about how checking properties is strictly stronger
   - Demonstrate the ease of comparing good Cryptol code with a specification  
4. Get students up and running
   - Verify (as well as possible) everyone can run the software for the course
   - Run the demo just worked themselves
5. Building familiarity with Cryptol 
   - Students interact and experiment with partially worked examples -- 
   - Verify some properties of common functions 
      - XOR, show double xor is the identity
      - Caeser Ciphers, show that encrypt/decrypt is the identity
   - Show examples of how the SAT tool can be used to solve puzzles
      - Sudoku
      - n-Queens
6. Programming with Cryptol, Round 1
   - Present material on some of the Cryptol language basics, students have seen
     some of this now in context and have examples to pull from
   - Have students write a variety of simple functions exercising different
     elements of Cryptol syntax -- there's a lot of this sort of thing in
     Galois' programming guide to pull from
   - Presenters walk around and assist as necessary  
7. Programming with Cryptol, Round 2
   - Have students try to work through a more complex cryptographic exercise
8. Verifying with SAW
   - Possibly have students follow a script to verify a provided example
   - Demonstrate how code from different languages can be brought together and
     properties checked
9. Introduction to advanced (new) tools
   - crux
   - argo
