# Salsa 20 Properties

In this module, we consider additional properties of the [Salsa20]
(../Salsa20.md) stream cipher, which has undergone much scrutiny since
being proposed for [eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project]
(https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream).

```

import labs::Salsa20::Salsa20
```

## Invertibility

Throughout [the original spec](https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/spec.pdf),
various functions are noted as being "invertible".  Let's specify this
formally in Cryptol, and then prove it for the components of Salsa20:

```
/** type of one-argument function from domain `a` to range `a'` */
type Unary a a' =
    a -> a'
```

**EXERCISE**: Define `inverts` to return `True` iff `g` [inverts]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) `f` for a given
argument `x`; i.e. `(f âˆ˜ g) x == x`:

```
/** whether unary function `g` inverts unary function `f` for argument `x` */
inverts :
    {a, a'}
    Unary a' a ->
    Unary a a' ->
    a -> Bit
inverts g f x =
    FalseBinary g f  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

### `littleendian`

Before moving to the various `round` functions, let's address
`littleendian`, which the original spec notes is invertible.

**EXERCISE**: Specify properties that `littleendian'` inverts
`littleendian`, and vice versa.

```
/** `littleendian` is invertible; its inverse is `littleendian'`. */
littleendian'_inverts_littleendian :
    Bytes 4 -> Bit
property littleendian'_inverts_littleendian =
    inverts littleendian' littleendian

/** `littleendian` is invertible; its inverse is `littleendian'`. */
littleendian_inverts_littleendian' :
    Bytes 4 -> Bit
property littleendian_inverts_littleendian' =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

### `quarterround`

Now let's proceed with the `round` functions...

> One can visualize the `quarterround` function as modifying `y` in
> place: first `y1` changes to `z1`, then `y2` changes to `z2`, then
> `y3` changes to `z3`, then `y0` changes to `z0`. Each modification
> is invertible, so the entire function is invertible. [5]

**EXERCISE**: Exhibit a function `quarterround_inverse` that inverts
`quarterround`; your function must satisfy
`quarterround_inverse_inverts_quarterround`:

```
/** inverse of `quarterround` */
quarterround_inverse :
    Words 4 -> Words 4
quarterround_inverse [z0, z1, z2, z3] =
    [y0, y1, y2, y3]
  where
    y0 = z0 ^ ((z3 + z2) <<< 0x00000012)
    y3 = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    y2 = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    y1 = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `quarterround` is invertible; its inverse is `quarterround_inverse`. */
quarterround_inverse_inverts_quarterround :
    Words 4 -> Bit
property quarterround_inverse_inverts_quarterround =
    inverts quarterround_inverse quarterround
```

Less interestingly, `quarterround` also inverts
`quarterround_inverse`.

**EXERCISE**: Define a `property` specifying that `quarterround`
inverts `quarterround_inverse`:

```
/** `quarterround_inverse` is invertible; its inverse is `quarterround`. */
quarterround_inverts_quarterround_inverse :
    Words 4 -> Bit
property quarterround_inverts_quarterround_inverse =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

### `rowround` and `columnround`

Similarly, though not called out in [5], `rowround` and `columnround`
are invertible.

**EXERCISE**: Exhibit inverse functions for `rowround` and
`columnround` and specify properties to verify their invertibility:

```

/** inverse of `rowround` */
rowround_inverse :
    Words 16 -> Words 16
rowround_inverse
    [z0, z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6, z7, z8, z9, z10, z11, z12, z13, z14, z15]
  = [y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9, y10, y11, y12, y13, y14, y15]
  where
    [y15, y12, y13, y14] = quarterround_inverse [z15, z12, z13, z14]
    [y10, y11,  y8,  y9] = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    [ y5,  y6,  y7,  y4] = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    [ y0,  y1,  y2,  y3] = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `rowround` is invertible; its inverse is `rowround_inverse`. */
rowround_inverse_inverts_rowround :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property rowround_inverse_inverts_rowround =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `rowround_inverse` is invertible; its inverse is `rowround`. */
rowround_inverts_rowround_inverse :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property rowround_inverts_rowround_inverse =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */


/** inverse of `columnround` */
columnround_inverse :
    Words 16 -> Words 16
columnround_inverse
    [y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9, y10, y11, y12, y13, y14, y15]
  = [x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x14, x15]
  where
    /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    [x0, x1,  x2,  x3,  x4,  x5,  x6,  x7,
     x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x14, x15] = zero

/** `columnround` is invertible; its inverse is `columnround_inverse`. */
columnround_inverse_inverts_columnround :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property columnround_inverse_inverts_columnround =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `columnround_inverse` is invertible; its inverse is `columnround`. */
columnround_inverts_columnround_inverse :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property columnround_inverts_columnround_inverse =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

```

## `doubleround`

**EXERCISE**: Finally, verify that `doubleround` is invertible.  This
should be straightforward given what `doubleround` does.

```
/** inverse of `doubleround` */
doubleround_inverse :
    Words 16 -> Words 16
doubleround_inverse xs =
    zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `doubleround` is invertible; its inverse is `doubleround_inverse` */
doubleround_inverse_inverts_doubleround :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property doubleround_inverse_inverts_doubleround =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `doubleround_inverse` is invertible; its inverse is `doubleround` */
doubleround_inverts_doubleround_inverse :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property doubleround_inverts_doubleround_inverse =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

## `Salsa20_encrypt`

Finally, we show that `Salsa20_encrypt` is invertible (there exists a
`Salsa20_decrypt` function that inverts `Salsa20_encrypt` for a given
key and nonce) and
[involutive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)
(applying `Salsa20_encrypt` twice for a given key and nonce yields the
original plaintext).

**EXERCISE**: Define involution.

```
involutive :
    {a}
    () => /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    Unary a a ->
    a -> Bit
involutive f =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

**EXERCISE**: Specify that `Salsa20_encrypt` is involutive:

```
Salsa20_encrypt_involutive :
    {l}    /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    () =>  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    Bytes l -> Bit
Salsa20_encrypt_involutive m =
    involutive clear m  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/* UNCOMMENT
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_1_1 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{1,1}
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_1_8 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{1,8}
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_1_64 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{1,64}
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_1_128 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{1,128}

property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_2_1 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{2,1}
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_2_8 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{2,8}
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_2_64 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{2,64}
property Salsa20_encrypt_involutive_2_128 = Salsa20_encrypt_involutive`{2,128}
*/
```

**EXERCISE**: Given that `Salsa20_encrypt` is involutive, it is
trivial to define and specify its inverse:

```
/**
 * inverse of `Salsa20_encrypt`
 */
/* Salsa20_decrypt :
 *     UNCOMMENT AND REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
Salsa20_decrypt k v m =
    zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/**
 * `Salsa20_decrypt` inverts `Salsa20_encrypt`.
 */
/* Salsa20_encrypt_recovery :
       UNCOMMENT AND REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
Salsa20_encrypt_recovery k v m =
    FalseBinary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/* UNCOMMENT
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_1_1 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{1,1}
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_1_8 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{1,8}
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_1_64 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{1,64}
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_1_128 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{1,128}

property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_2_1 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{2,1}
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_2_8 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{2,8}
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_2_64 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{2,64}
property Salsa20_encrypt_recovery_2_128 = Salsa20_encrypt_recovery`{2,128}
*/
```


# Collisions

Dr. Bernstein clarifies, "I originally introduced the Salsa20 core as
the "Salsa20 hash function," but this terminology turns out to confuse
people who think that "hash function" means "collision-resistant
compression function."  The Salsa20 core does not compress and is not
collision-resistant." [1]

This was in response [2] to a paper [3] detailing collisions in
Salsa20, which Dr. Bernstein calls "plagiarism of an observation that
was made by Matt Robshaw in June 2005, that was independently posted
to `sci.crypt` by David Wagner in September 2005 [4]..."  High drama!

That Salsa20 (core) does not compress is obvious from its type
signature (`Bytes 64 -> Bytes 64`).  Let's explore its collisions
using Cryptol...


## General Definitions

First, consider what it means for a function of one argument to
*collide*.

**EXERCISE**: Define `Collidable` to specify a constraint over the
unary function argument to determine whether it can collide.

```
/** constraints under which a unary function from `a` to `a'` can collide */
type constraint Collidable a a' =
    (Zero a, Zero a')  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

**EXERCISE**: Define `collides` to return `True` iff a unary function
`f` returns the same value for arguments `x` and `x'`:

```
/** whether unary function `f` returns the same value for `x` and `x'` */
collides :
    {a, a'}
    Collidable a a' =>
    Unary a a' ->
    a -> a -> Bit
collides f x1 x2 =
    False  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

Now we can apply these definitions to components of Salsa20...

```
/**
 * whether unary function `f` differs for all different inputs `x1` and `x2`
 */
has_no_collisions :
    {a, a'}
    Collidable a a' =>
    Unary a a' ->
    a -> a -> Bit
has_no_collisions f x1 x2 =
    ~ (collides f x1 x2)

/** `quarterround` has no collisions. */
quarterround_has_no_collisions :
    Words 4 -> Words 4 -> Bit
property quarterround_has_no_collisions =
    has_no_collisions quarterround
```

## `rowround`, `columnround`  

**EXERCISE**: Introduce properties specifying whether `rowround` and
`columnround` are each collision-free:

```
/** `rowround` has no collisions. */
rowround_has_no_collisions :
    Words 4 -> Bit
property rowround_has_no_collisions =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

/** `columnround` has no collisions. */
columnround_has_no_collisions :
    Words 4 -> Bit
property columnround_has_no_collisions =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

## `doubleround`

**EXERCISE**: Is `doubleround` also collision free?  Specify a
property stating whether this is the case, and use Cryptol to prove it
or find a counterexample:

```
/** `doubleround` has no collisions. */
doubleround_has_no_collisions :
    Words 4 -> Bit
property doubleround_has_no_collisions =
    FalseUnary  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

## `Salsa20`

Depending on the platform, `> :prove doubleround_has_no_collisions`
may have taken a while...  Given the definition of `Salsa20` and the
invertibility and collision properties established to this point, can
you conclude whether or not `Salsa20` is collision-free?  Can Cryptol
just tell us?  Let's find out...

**EXERCISE**: Using `:check` and `:prove`, try to determine whether
`Salsa20` is collision-free.  While you await an answer, consider the
question yourself.  Reading [2]-[4] should pass the time nicely...

```
/** `Salsa20` has no collisions...or does it? */
Salsa20_has_no_collisions :
    Bytes 64 -> Bytes 64 -> Bit
property Salsa20_has_no_collisions =
    has_no_collisions Salsa20Hash
```

When you are ready to move on, interrupt Cryptol (`Ctrl-C`) (unless it
has reported unsatisfiability or a counterexample).

Spoiler: `Salsa20` collides.  This is the function that inspired the
aforementioned drama.  Working from [3], Theorem 6 states the
collision property for the `Salsa20` core function:

> Any pair of inputs M and M' (defined below) such that `Z < 2^^31`
> and `Z' = Z + 2^^31`, generate a collision for any number of rounds
> of the `Salsa20` "hash" [core] function, producing `h` (defined
> below) as a common hash value.
> 
> M =  [  Z , -Z ,  Z , -Z
>      , -Z ,  Z , -Z ,  Z
>      ,  Z , -Z ,  Z , -Z
>      , -Z ,  Z , -Z ,  Z  ]
> M' = [  Z', -Z',  Z', -Z'
>      , -Z',  Z', -Z',  Z'
>      ,  Z', -Z',  Z', -Z'
>      , -Z',  Z', -Z',  Z' ]
> h  = 2*M

In this definition, `Z` and `Z'` are `Word`s, but our Cryptol spec
follows the original in defining `Salsa20` to map `Bytes 64 ->
Bytes 64`.  Thus, we will reshape `Salsa20` before proceeding:

**EXERCISE**: Define `Salsa20'` to mimic `Salsa20`, but over
`Words 16` rather than `Bytes 64`: (Hint: This can be defined in
one line with `doubleround`, `iterate`, and basic Cryptol operators.)

```
/** `Salsa20` equivalent over `Words 16` */
Salsa20' :
  Words 16 -> Words 16
Salsa20' x =
  zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

**EXERCISE**: Verify that `Salsa20'` agrees with `Salsa20`:

```
Salsa20'_equiv_Salsa20 :
    Words 16 -> Bit
Salsa20'_equiv_Salsa20 w =
    Salsa20' w == dejigger (Salsa20Hash (rejigger w))
      where
        rejigger x = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
        dejigger x = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

**EXERCISE** Formalize Theorem 6 :

```
Salsa20'_collides_Th6 :
    [32] -> Bit
property Salsa20'_collides_Th6 Z =
    collides Salsa20' M M' /\
    h == (zero : Words 16)  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
      where
        Z' = Z  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
        M  = [  Z , -Z ,  Z , -Z
             , -Z ,  Z , -Z ,  Z
             ,  Z , -Z ,  Z , -Z
             , -Z ,  Z , -Z ,  Z ]
        M' = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
        h  = zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
        h' = h  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

```

Theorem 7 [3] states a corresponding [2nd preimage attack]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack):

> Any pair of inputs `A, B` with a difference `A - B = A ^ B == D` (defined 
> below) will produce the same output [of `Salsa20`] over any number of rounds.
> 
> A - B = A ^ B = [ 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000
>                 , 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000
>                 , 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000
>                 , 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0x80000000 ]

We might ask Cryptol to convince us whether this property holds, but
before proceeding with the general theorem, let's first address the
case of one round:

```
/** Theorem 7 [3] holds for one round. */
Salsa20'_collides_Th7_oneround :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property Salsa20'_collides_Th7_oneround x =
    Salsa20' x == Salsa20' zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
```

Trying to `:prove` this might have taken a while.  Let's cautiously
move on to the general case.

**EXERCISE** State and try to `:prove` Theorem 7 for any number of
rounds.

```
/** Theorem 7 [3] holds for any number of rounds...well, _almost_ any... */
Salsa20'_collides_Th7 :
    {n}
    (fin n) =>
    [n] -> Words 16 -> Bit  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
Salsa20'_collides_Th7 i x =
    True \/                         /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */
    iterate Salsa20' x @ i == zero  /* REPLACE WITH YOUR DEFINITION */

property Salsa20'_collides_Th7_2_rounds =
    Salsa20'_collides_Th7 (2 : [2])

property Salsa20'_collides_Th7_3_rounds =
    Salsa20'_collides_Th7 (3 : [2])
```


# Additional Exercises

The original spec remarks on some other interesting properties:
  * **EXERCISE**: Specify and prove that `littleendian` meets
    Dr. Bernstein's arithmetic specification:
    > If `b = (b0, b1, b2, b3)` then
      `littleendian(b) = b0 + 2^8*b + 2^16*b^2 + 2^24*b^3`
  * **EXERCISE**: Define
    [`transpose`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose) and verify
    that `columnround M == transpose rowround M` (and vice versa)
  * **EXERCISE**: The original spec mentions parallel visualizations
    of `rowround`, `columnround`, and `doubleround`.  Such an
    interpretation of `rowround` follows.  Specify parallel
    interpretations for `columnround` and `doubleround`, and verify
    that these are correct.
  * **EXERCISE** Alternative Salsa20-based stream ciphers (Salsa20/8 and
    Salsa20/12) have been specified to improve performance. Specify these and
    verify basic cryptographic properties such as plaintext recovery.


```
/** parallel "visualization" of `rowround` */
rowround_parallel :
    Words 16 -> Words 16
rowround_parallel ys =
    join [ (quarterround (yi<<<i))>>>i | yi <- split ys | i <- [0 .. 3] : [4][2] ]

/**
 * The parallel "visualization" of `rowround` is equivalent to its explicit 
 * specification.
 */
rowround_parallel_is_rowround :
    Words 16 -> Bit
property rowround_parallel_is_rowround =
    rowround === rowround_parallel
```
